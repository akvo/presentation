#+TITLE: Integrating AI into Akvo's Offerings and Internal Operations
#+AUTHOR: Deden Bangkit

* Problem Akvo Can Help Solve with AI

** Applications Based on Past POC Successes

*** Angkor Salad Project (G4AW, 2019):

- **Objective**: Provide Efficiency in Accessing Market Information
- Chatbots / Virtual Assistants targeting farmers in Cambodia
- Utilized Akvo Flow Data Collected Daily by Our Partner

** The Missing Elements:

- **AI-Driven Insights**. The project lacked AI-generated insights due to the absence of generative text capabilities. While data collection was robust, the ability to derive actionable insights directly from the data using AI was missing.
- **AI-Generated Recommendations for Targeted Actions**. While the visualisations provided valuable insights, AI could be use to recommend specific interventions or prioritize actions based on the identified needs.
- **Automated Data Processing**. The project may have faced challenges with manual data processing and analysis. AI-driven automation could have streamlined these processes, allowing for faster decision-making and more efficient utilization of resources.

* Realistic Possibilities with AI

By integrating AI-generated text, starting small and building on past successes allows for incremental adoption and maximizes the impact of AI integration.

** Akvo's Internal

**Integration of AI-Generated Text**

- Provide a Channel for Data Analysis and Insights
- Example: Integrating OpenAI API into Slack for flexible and time-cost-effective Data Analysis

** Partners

**Enhancing Existing / Upcomming Projects with AI**

- Reflect on Past Successes and Identify Opportunities for Enhancement
- Example: Implement AI-Generated Text for Chatbots to Provide Personalized Recommendations for better user experience


* Next Steps

** Short-Term
- **Set Up Free ChatBot Channel**: Initiate a Free ChatBot Channel in Slack as a Realistic First Step. Efforts are Manageable, Serving as a Starting Point for Further AI Exploration
- **Invest in Developer Learning**: Provide Learning Opportunities for Developers to Acquire AI Development Expertise
- **Explore Project Opportunities**: BD Teams to Identify Project Opportunities as Starting Points for Partner Offerings

** Long-Term
- **Contribute Data to OpenAI**: Utilize Akvo Flow, Akvo RSR, and Other Platforms to Contribute to OpenAI's Data Pool. Example: Referencing the Potential of Data Contribution to OpenAI as Demonstrated in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNKu307k59g
